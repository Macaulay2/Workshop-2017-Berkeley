<P>
    Lara Anderson - "The geometry of heterotic/F-theory duality"
 
<br>
      [<A href="javascript:;" onclick="toggleDisplay('LAnderson');">abstract</A>] 

<div id="LAnderson" style="display: none">
I will provide an overview of compactification in string theory and the
way in which the structure of the physical theory is intrinsically
intertwined with questions in differential and algebraic geometry. In
particular, I will highlight heterotic string theory and F-theory and
describe an analysis of a broad class of dual heterotic and F-theory
compactification that give to four-dimensional supergravity theories. This
study will link moduli spaces and deformation problems of higher rank
sheaves over 3- (complex) dimensional Calabi-Yau threefolds to the
geometry of 4-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds.

Dan Bates - "Parameter homotopies for applications"
 
<br>
        [<A href="javascript:;"
        onclick="toggleDisplay('DBates');">abstract</A>]

<div id="DBates" style="display: none">
The standard methods of numerical algebraic geometry have been useful for approximating solutions of polynomial systems in a number of applications.  For
problems involving parameters, there is a special technique that is particularly efficient - the parameter homotopy.  In this talk, I will introduce this fairly
simple concept, briefly describe a new software package - Paramotopy - that simplifies such runs (joint with Dan Brake and Matt Niemerg), and describe two
applications, one in biochemistry (joint with Brake, Jeremy Gunawardena, Benjmin Gyori, and Chris Nam) and one in engineering (joint with Brake, Tony Maciejewski,
and Vakhtang Putkaradze).

David Eisenbud - "Tying Betti numbers together"
 
<br>
      [<A href="javascript:;"
        onclick="toggleDisplay('DEisenbud');">abstract</A>] 

<div id="DEisenbud" style="display: none">
If $M$ is a graded module over $k[x_1, \dots x_n]$  (or a
module over a regular local ring) that is annihilated by a regular
sequence $f_1,\dots f_m$, then the homotopies for the $f_i$ make
$Tor(M,k)$ into a module over an exterior algebra on $m$ generators.
This action is often trivial, but if $M$ is actually a (sufficiently)
high syzygy module over $S/(f_1,\dots,f_m)$, then the action is highly
nontrivial. I will describe what I know about this, and pose some open
questions. This is joint work with Irena Peeva.

James Gray - "Computation of moduli spaces of holomorphic bundles in heterotic
string theory"
 
<br>
        [<A href="javascript:;"
        onclick="toggleDisplay('JGray');">abstract</A>]

<div id="JGray" style="display: none">
I will describe the importance of understanding the moduli
spaces of holomorphic bundles to the physics of heterotic string theory. I
will set up some examples as explicit algebraic varieties and will describe
how we analyze them using techniques of computational commutative algebra.
I will emphasize those properties of these varieties that we can compute,
as well as those that we would like to know about and as yet can not
obtain.

Yang-Hui He - " In Praise of Macaulay2: Some perspectives from Theoretical Physics"
 
<br>
        [<A href="javascript:;"
        onclick="toggleDisplay('YHe');">abstract</A>]

<div id="YHe" style="display: none">
We give an overview of some classes of problems in theoretical high
energy and mathematical physics wherein Macaulay2 and the methods of
computational algebraic geometry have been an indispensable tool.
Topics will include Calabi-Yau geometries in the context of string
compactifications, moduli space of gauge theories, bipartite graphs on Riemann surfaces and associated
toric geometry, as well as the interplay between operators, quivers and modularity.
